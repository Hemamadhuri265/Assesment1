In the part of Assesment 
there are four questions 
1. calculator using some mathematical operations .
2. odd series based on the range.
3. odd series and also when the even range entered the value should be same as previous odd range .
4. taking the list of elements and  checking the each number divisible from 1 to 9 range .

I used java language to solve these questions
